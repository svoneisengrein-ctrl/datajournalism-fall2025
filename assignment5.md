 # Lede

### The lede starts with example from the data. It talks about an example of back-to-back heat waves in 2020 and the real lives claimed by the heat wave. I think it was effective in engaging the reader because it gives you enough information as to where you know what the story is about and that there is going to be data and numbers involved. However, it leaves you wanting to know and understand more. Especially after the lede’s closing sentence of “All told, the analysis estimates that extreme heat caused about 3,900 deaths.”. Overall, I believe the author made the right choice using this style of lede over the others because it highlights the stakes and the personal aspects of the story. 
# Sources 

### This story used a combination of real anecdotal evidence from the family members of the victims and experts. However, it is mostly experts. These experts include Dr Aaron Berstein, pediatrician at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Edith B. de Guzman, UCLA researcher on how to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures on L.A. neighborhoods, California Environmental Protection Agency. The real people include the daughter of a victim and the son of a victim. Every source aligns with the author’s findings. From the experts who agree that more need to track data on heat-related illnesses to increase the effectiveness and timeliness of treatment. To the real people who believe that the deaths of their loved ones could have been prevented if more information had been collected in the past. 

### Overall, I believe the combination of the two types of sources was the most effective way to build validity to the argument the author is making with the data. This is because the experts build ethos with the reader, then the real people build pathos. Thus, combining validity and emotion to form an effective argument. 
# Structure 

### This story structure is circle/bookend. It briefly mentions two victims in the lede and then goes into more detail in the center of the story, and then finally at the end of the story you hear from the victims’ families again. It also partially uses the martini glass structure. It uses subheadings to help the reader identify the key parts of what is behind these tragedies and the argument he is making with the data. The subheadings include a hidden toll, invisible deaths, behind on reducing risks.

# Numbers 

### I feel that the writing about the data was clear and engaging. Overall, I feel that there weren’t any points that were too data heavy. The introduction to each point was brought about naturally and was backed by either an anecdote or an expert testimonial. For example, under the subheading “A hidden toll” the author writes “A study published last year in the journal Environmental Epidemiology found that in the 297 most populous counties in the U.S., at least 5,600 deaths annually might be caused by heat.” Then he goes on to talk about a Times analysis that showed the same results. Furthermore, he uses this data to segue into his main argument: we need better tracking of heat-related illnesses and deaths.

### Additionally, all the data was presented in an easy-to-understand way. Such as, in the lede when the Times analysis is first mentioned, the data is presented and then is followed by the graphic, which helps to ease the reader into the data of the article.

# Data Visulization 

### This article doesn’t contain a lot of data visualizations; however, the three that do allow for a better understanding of the data they are related to. In the lede we see a column visualization having to do with time. Next we see a striped climate visualization. Then, finally, we see a color-coded map. I think the limited use if graphics helps with the simplicity and the personalization of the story. If there were more graphics if would have taken the pathos out of the story and made it less personal. Furthermore, I think the places the author did use them they were necessary. This is because they are displaying the big data. Such as, the Time analysis deaths and the increasing temperatures.

# Methods

### The author addresses nuances at the end of the article using a “nerd box”. Within the nerd box is where their data came from and who has reviewed the Times’ analysis. Finally, where you can get the access to the complete data. It is straight to the point and informative. I do think this was necessary because there is a section of this audience that is educated individuals who would care. The target audience of this piece would be not only the general public but also people with knowledge of the subject as it is more of a niche piece. Therefore, I do believe that the nerd box is necessary.
