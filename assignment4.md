# Chart One 
## [Where are Consumers Shopping](https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/halloween/halloween-data-center)
## [Edited data](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1TpygNbs/mmGNxt7AJy0GYYLjeDqXQg/edit)
#### - I combined all destinations under 10% into the other category. This makes the data look less cluttered and overwhelming. 
#### - I edited the title of the graph to better explain what it was about. 
#### - I dropped the store lable from each destination as this also made the data look cluttered. 
#### - I changed it from the cluttered column type chart to a less overwhelming pie chart. 

# Chart two 
## [Decadal average: Annual number of deaths from distasters](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters#explore-data-on-natural-disasters)
## [Edited data](https://github.com/svoneisengrein-ctrl/datajournalism-fall2025/blob/main/New%20chart%20.pdf) 
#### - In the new chart I kept the data to just the global average and each continents average to make it less overwhelming 
#### - I also added clor to make quick visual comparison easier 
#### - Instead of doing it by every decade I did it by every two decades to also make the data loook less cluttered.  
#### - I changed it from a cloumn to bar chart for better comparison as well.
