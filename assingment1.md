[Failing schools in Florida](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/5-schools-segregation/)
# Clarity and accuracy

I was immediatley able to identify the central inight that was being communicated. I would rate it a five overall. It was straight to the point and even in the headline. The central insight is that Florida public schools are begining to fail to meet the needs of minority dominated schools even Yes and no it fails to meantion the schools were in minority communities but it meantions everything else. 

There was no data visual. 

Overall knowing Florida and their politics as whole this data seems very accurate. However I would give it between a 3.5 or a four. This is because for some data points he tells us where they were obtained from such as, State of Department education records and statewide kindergarten readiness data shows he doesn't always say where the data came from. This make me question those data points. Also he never compares the data to nation wide data. If he did compare it nation wide this would allow for some valididity and would truly drive home the central insight. Overall, he does a good job explaining the data he does offer.  

# Quality
I would rate the quality overall, a five. The story telling flowed really well and the data anylsis felt natural within the story being told. I think that is one of the best parts of this article as a whole is the story telling aspect of the artcile. The author really makes you feel for the families and educators of these school districts. One thing I think could be improved upon the conclusion. It feels very sudden and rushed. It could benefit from some more sentences and thoughts espeacially because this is a longer article. 

# Type and Color 
Other than when writing out Times there is no use use of type or color in this article. Times is put in italics. With that being said I would give both type and color ones. 

# Creativity
Creatively I would rank it a 3. The author uses lots of photos to not only flow you through the story but to further draw empathy from the audience. There are ohotos of students and parents teary eyed. These are paired with photos from inside classrooms and the real effected schools. This allows the reader to really connectwith the story and put faces and locations to the data. Overall I would rank the effectiveness of the photos a five. They turn the data from numbers to people. 

# Pitch 
The question I want to answer is how different generations view marriage and is one less likely to get married. I would look at data sets that track marriage statistics and the ages of those invovled. I would also look at surveys or take surveys on different stances on marriage. This is timely now because there are a lot of claims going around that Gen Z doesn't beleive in marriage, and that the concept of marriage is dying generation by generation. So I would like to look and see if there is any truth to these claims. I would talk to average people across generations (Gen x - Gen z). I also think I would talk to officals in charge of lisencing distribution however this may be hard due to each state having a slightly different processes and such.
