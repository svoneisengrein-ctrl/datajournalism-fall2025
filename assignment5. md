#Lede 

## The lede starts with example from the data. It talks about an example of back-to-back heat waves in 2020 and the real lives claimed by the heat wave. I think it was effective in engaging the reader because it gives you enough information as to where you know what the story is about and that there is going to be data and numbers involved. However, it leaves you wanting to know and understand more. Especially after the lede’s closing sentence of “All told, the analysis estimates that extreme heat caused about 3,900 deaths.”. Overall, I believe the author made the right choice using this style of lede over the others because it highlights the stakes and the personal aspects of the story.
